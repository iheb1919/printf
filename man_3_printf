.SH NAME
_printf \- format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B _printf
FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
.B _printf
OPTION

.B #include 'holberton.h'
(or any other custom made header file)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Print ARGUMENTS(s) according to FORMAT.
FORMAT controls the output as in C _printf

return value
      Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters p-
      rinted (excluding the null byte  used to end output to strings).

the conversion specifier
      A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.  The con-
      version specifiers and their meanings are:

      c       for a one character char type.

      s       for multi character char type.

      d, i    The  int  argument  is  converted to signed decimal notation.  The
              precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must a-
              ppear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is  padded
              on the left with zeros.  The default precision is 1.  When 0 is p-
              rinted with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

      %       A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conver-
              sion specification is '%%'.

.SH BUGS
We tried many main excecutions but we couldn't the tiny error in the function.
We're doing our best to find it.
